Here's a step-by-step approach to configure this repository locally:

    Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

    Install Node.js:
        Make sure you have Node.js version 20.x installed
        You can download it from https://nodejs.org/

    Install PostgreSQL:
        Install PostgreSQL 16.x from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
        Create a new database
        Note down your database connection URL

    Set up environment variables:
        Create a 

    file in the root directory
    Add your DATABASE_URL:

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/<database_name>

    Install dependencies:

npm install

    Run database migrations:

npm run db:push

    Optional: Seed the database:

chmod +x scripts/seed.sh
./scripts/seed.sh

    Start the development server:

npm run dev

The application should now be running on port 5000. You can access it at http://localhost:5000

Note: The app uses a full-stack setup with:

    Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
    Backend: Express.js
    Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
    Authentication: Passport.js

Make sure all these services are running properly for the application to work correctly.
